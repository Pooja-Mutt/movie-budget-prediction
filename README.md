# 🎬 Movie Budget vs Revenue - Capstone Project

This project explores whether movie production budgets are related to their worldwide revenue using real data and machine learning.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Seaborn (data visualization)
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Google Colab

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: `cost_revenue_dirty.csv` (cleaned in the notebook)

## 📈 What I Did
- Cleaned data (removed $ and , from numbers)
- Visualized with scatter plots and regression lines
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict revenue
- Interpreted results and answered the research question

## 🤖 Prediction Example
> For a movie with $200,000,000 budget → Predicted revenue: **$645M**

## 💡 What I Learned
- Real-world data is messy!
- Seaborn makes visualizing easy and beautiful
- Scikit-learn makes building prediction models fun

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Upload the CSV to Google Colab
2. Run the notebook step-by-step
3. Try your own budget in the prediction cell!
